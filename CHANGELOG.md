## [0.3.1] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- Request truncation: the current turn (user message, referenced files, and current-turn tool results) and attachments are never cut; only prior turns are reduced (by summarising compaction, or archived before dropping), and an over-limit current turn fails loudly without sending.
- Reviewer (Mashūra) dispatch sends documents whole or in labelled parts with ~200-token overlap, or fails loudly when an atomic source file or section cannot fit; per-file, total-source, briefing, and findings truncation caps are removed, and `mashura__*` async results are delivered whole.
- Incomplete reviewer replies (`finish_reason=length` / `stop_reason=max_tokens` after a chunked retry, empty replies, or missing/mismatched `LAST SECTION READ:` citation) are marked VOID and never counted as a review round or as "no findings".
- The "collapsed request" line (and compaction notices) names what was archived and where (message range, tool-result IDs, byte and approximate token counts, and archive path).
- `@file` attachments are injected whole, failing loudly above a 64 MB sanity limit instead of truncating at 50 KB / 800 lines.

### Added

- Optional `hisn` sandbox backend (`sandbox.backend = "hisn"`, flag `--sandbox hisn`, env `WAKIL_SANDBOX_BACKEND=hisn`; requires `hisn >= 0.2.1`): control-socket exec with `exec_id` (`SCM_RIGHTS` stdio fd passing, signals on fresh connections, latched acceptance/exit), `--ready-fd` readiness with live confirmation, per-project persistent home (`sandbox.hisn.home_root`), and `sandbox.hisn.*` configuration (`binary`, `home_root`, `grantable_rw`, `env_pass`, `tmp_size_mb`, `shm_size_mb`, `exec_via_cli`).
- `docker_allow_userns` (`sandbox.docker.allow_userns`, off by default) to allow unprivileged user namespaces inside the Docker sandbox container for `hisn` development.
- Per-model reviewer limits under `mashura_models.<model>.{context_tokens,review_max_tokens}`.
- Per-model and per-role reasoning budgets (`mashura_models.<model>.reasoning`, `mashura_roles.{reviewer,check}.reasoning`) with `/think` and `--think` runtime control; reviewer reasoning is capped at 16384 tokens.
- Streaming reviewer calls with idle timeout (120 s no bytes) and a 30 min total cap, replacing the 300 s total timeout; `reasoning N / answer M` in the Mashūra footer.
- `context_tail_answer_bytes` now defaults to `0` (prior assistant reports in the long-session tail are kept whole by default).

### Known

- Reviewer models with large reasoning output can hit the answer budget (fix planned); the 300 s request timeout is now a 30 min total cap with a 120 s idle deadline.
- Browser tools (`browser_*`) and staging (`kvr`) tools are unavailable under the `hisn` backend.
